# WOBBClone

A clone UI of the WOBB app. The actual mobile app can be found at Google <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wobb.hunted&hl=en">Play store</a> or Apple <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wobb-jobs/id981491669">App store</a>. </br>

This app has only been tested on Oneplus 6 & Pixel 2.
